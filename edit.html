                the sky is the wide,open space above us,sretching from horizon to horizon.
                during the day,it often appears blue because sunlight scatters through the atmosphere.
                clouds drift across it in different shapes sometimes fluffy and white,other times dark and heavy with rain.
                at sunrise and sunset,the sky glows with briliant colors like orange,pink,and purple.
                at night it turns deep and dark dotted with stars,planet,and the moon.
                the sky constantly changes,making it one of natures most peaceful and inspiring sights.
